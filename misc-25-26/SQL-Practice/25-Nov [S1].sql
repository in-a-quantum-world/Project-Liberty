/*
HOW DIVISION WORK <-- MY INTUITION

ah i can kinda see how division works. now... it works similar to WHERE NOT 
EXISTS i presume?

and it primarily works through listing out all possible combinations first. and 
then subtracting the stuff that exists inside R... which what's leftover is... i 
mean, if theres stuff left over from RXS - R... then this means that these rows 
are incomplete...

and then u project, and then subtract these incomplete rows from the list of all
possible rows... and what's left are the rows thats complete?

-- 1. PROJECT AND PROJECT
    -- π_X π_Y R ≡ π_X R    (if X⊆Y)

-- Inefficient (nested projection)
SELECT name, age
FROM (
    SELECT name, age, salary, dept
    FROM employee
) AS temp;

-- Equivalent and better
SELECT name, age
FROM employee;

-- **Use:** Simplifies nested queries - eliminate redundant intermediate 
--          projections.

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

-- 2. PROJECT AND SELECT
    -- π_X σ_P(Y) R ≡ σ_P(Y) π_X R    (if Y⊆X)
    
    -- Meaning: You can swap SELECT and PROJECT if the condition uses only
    --          projected attributes.

-- Original (filter then project)
SELECT name, salary
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM employee
    WHERE salary > 50000
) AS temp;

-- Equivalent (project then filter)
SELECT name, salary
FROM employee
WHERE salary > 50000

-- **Use:** Push selection down or up depending on what's more efficient.

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

-- 3. PROJECT AND PRODUCT (Cartesian Product)
    -- π_X (R × S) ≡ π_(X∩Attrs(R)) R × π_(X∩Attrs(S)) S

    -- Meaning: When projecting from a product, you can project each table 
    --          separately first.

-- Inefficient (full cross product then project)
SELECT account.num, branch.bname
FROM account
CROSS JOIN branch;

-- Equivalent (project first, then cross product) - way better!
SELECT a.num, b.bname
FROM (SELECT num FROM account) AS a
CROSS JOIN (SELECT bname FROM branch) AS b;

-- Use: Reduce data sie before expensive operations. Project early to minimize
--      intermediate result size.

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

-- 4. PROJECT AND UNION
    -- π_X (R ∪ S) ≡ π_X R ∪ π_X S

    -- Meaning: Projecting a union = union of projections.

-- Version 1 (union then project)
SELECT ename, salary
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM employee_2024
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM employee_2025
);

-- Equivalent Version 2 (project then union)
SELECT ename, salary FROM employee_2024
UNION                             -- union does not allow for duplicate elements
SELECT ename, salary FROM employee_2025;

-- Use: Version 2 is usually better - projects before combining, reducing data
--      movment

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

-- 5. PROJECT AND DIFFERENCE
    -- π_X (R - S) ⊇ π_X R - π_X S

    -- Meaning: NOT EQUAL! (note the ⊇ symbol). LHS has more or equal rows than
    --          RHS.

-- Use: Be carful! You **cannot** always push projections through differences.
--      LHS is safer.

-- 1. SELECT AND PROJECT

-- 2. SELECT AND SELECT

SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM employee
    WHERE salary > 50000
)
WHERE dept = "Sales";

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary > 50000 AND depth = "Sales";

-- Use: Combine multiple WHERE conditions into one. Database can optimise 
--      single condition better.

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

-- 3. SELECT AND PRODUCT
    -- σ_P(X) (R × S) ≡ σ_P(X) R × S    (if X⊆Attrs(R))

    -- Meaning: If filter only uses attributes from R, filter R first before 
    --          the product.

-- Inefficient (cross product then filter)
SELECT *
FROM account
CROSS JOIN branch
WHERE account.sortcode = 56;

-- Equivalent and much better! (filter then cross product)
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT * FROM account WHERE account.sortcode = 56) a
CROSS JOIN branch b;

-- Use: Critical optimization! Filter before joining to reduce intermediate
--      size dramatically.

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

-- 4. SELECT AND UNION
    -- σ_P(X) (R ∪ S) ≡ σ_P(X) R ∪ σ_P(X) S

    -- Meaning: Filtering a union = union of filtered results

-- Version 1 (union then filter)
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM employee_2024
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM employee_2025
)
WHERE dept = "sales"

-- Equivalent Version 2 (filter then union) - often better! 
SELECT * FROM employee_2024 WHERE dept = "sales"
UNION 
SELECT * FROM employee_2025 WHERE dept = "sales"

-- Use: Push filters down to each branch - can use indexes on individual tables!

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

-- 5. SELECT AND DIFFERENCE
    -- σ_P(X) (R - S) ≡ σ_P(X) R - S

    -- Meaning: Filtering a difference = filter first relation, then subtract

SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM all_employees
    EXCEPT
    SELECT * FROM terminated_employees
)
WHERE dept = 'sales';

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT * FROM all_employees WHERE dept = 'sales')
EXCEPT (SELECT * FROM terminated_employees);

-- Use: Filter the first relation early to reduce data before set difference
--      (which is an expensive operation, I presume).
